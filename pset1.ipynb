    "In linear algebra, it is critically important to think about the *shape* (size) of matrices and vectors, and whether operations make sense.   You can multiply $AB$ if $A$ is $m \\times n$ ($m$ rows and $n$ columns) and $B$ is $n \\times p$ — the \"middle\" dimensions need to match up.  You can also add matrices of *equal* sizes, or multiply them by scalars.  Multiplying $Ax$, an $m \\times n$ matrix $A$ by an $n$-component vector, can be thought of as a special case of this rule if you think of $x$ as an $n \\times 1$ \"matrix\".  On exams, it is common for people to panic and start writing down nonsense, and an easy way to catch this is to make sure that the operations you are writing down have the correct shapes.\n",
