    "One of the basic operations in linear algebra is [matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication) $C=AB$, computing the product of an $m \\times n$ matrix $A$ with an $n \\times p$ matrix $B$ to produce an $m \\times p$ matrix $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstractly, the rules for matrix multiplication are determined once you define how to multiply matrices by vectors $Ax$, the central [linear operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map) of 18.06, by requiring that multiplication be [associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property).  That is, we require:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A(Bx)=(AB)x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "for all matrices $A$ and $B$ and all vectors $x$.  The expression $A(Bx)$ involves only matrix × vector (computing $y=Bx$ then $Ay$), and requiring this to equal $(AB)x$ actually uniquely defines the matrix–matrix product $AB$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Perspective 1: rows × columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of how you derive it, the end result is the familar definition that you take **dot products of rows of A with columns of B** to get the product $C$.  For example:\n",

    "\n",
    "Essentially all matrix multiplications in practice are done with a version of this formula — at least, with the same operations, but often the *order* in which you multiply/add individual numbers is re-arranged.\n",
